    "## Hyperparameters Tuning and Final Model\n",
    "Due to the distinct characteristics of the ETHNICITY dataset, the optimal hyperparameters identified through cross-validation for the binary classification task (Question 2), are no longer suitable for the current research objective. Therefore, we perform a new **5-fold cross-validation** procedure to tune the hyperparameters â€” including kernel type, kernel parameters, and classification strategy (one-vs-rest or one-vs-one) â€” aiming to maximize validation accuracy. The final model is then trained using the **best-performing configuration**.\n"
