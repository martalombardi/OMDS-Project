It relies on the custom binary SVM solver implemented in Question 3, the Most Violating Pair (`MVP`) algorithm, as its base estimator.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, we perform a new **5-fold cross-validation** procedure to tune the hyperparameters â€” including kernel type, kernel parameters, and classification strategy (one-vs-rest or one-vs-one) â€” aiming to maximize validation accuracy. The final model is then trained using the **best-performing configuration**.\n"
