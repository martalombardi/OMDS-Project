    "We now perform **5-fold cross-validation** on the training data to assess the optimal Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network architecture. This method involves partitioning the training set into k=5 equally sized, disjoint subsets. For each fold $i\\in\\{1,…,5\\}$, the model is trained on the data from the other 4 folds and subsequently evaluated on the held-out fold $F_i$\n",

    "- Number of layers ($L\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$)\n",

    "For each unique combination of hyperparameters within this grid, a model is trained and evaluated $5$ times (once for each fold). The \"best performance on average on validation sets\" refers to the mean evaluation metric (specifically, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error, MAPE) computed across these $5$ validation folds for that particular hyperparameter combination. The **optimal MLP architecture** is then identified as the combination of hyperparameters from the grid that yields the **lowest average MAPE** across its respective cross-validation folds. This averaging process provides a more robust and reliable estimate of the model's performance by reducing the variance associated with a single train/validation split."
